It is the main focus of this lecture on pulling and analyzing fitbit data. The pdf version is also uploaded in DSP notes. My notes at this point can only go through the steps. If you want to have this notebook run properly. Please clone this repo: [https://github.com/evidation-health/EvidationDataScienceModule] It will contain everything you need to use.\n",
