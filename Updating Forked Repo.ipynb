    "# Updating your forked repo\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we discussed in Lab 1 (Introduction to Git),  we 'forked' the course repo to our own Github account in order to have access to the course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first time that we forked the repo in question, the most updated version of the course repo was copied to your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, as the class progresses (and more material is added to the main repo), we want to be able to reflect those changes to our forked account. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To do so, we will follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Configuring a remote for a fork\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can sync your fork with an upstream repository, you must configure a remote that points to the main repository in Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must configure a remote that points to the `UCSB-PSTAT-134-234/Spring-2018` repository (the original course repo) in Git to sync changes you make in a fork with the original repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sync changes made in the original repository with the fork:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. List the current configured remote repository for your fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git remote -v`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCSB-PSTAT-134-234/Spring-2018.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git remote -v`\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Syncing a fork\n",
    "\n",
    "To sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository follow the next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the current working directory to your local project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "    `git fetch upstream`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, `upstream/master`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Check out your fork's local master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git checkout master`\n",
    "        \n",
    "5. Merge the changes from `upstream/master` into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `git merge upstream/master`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Push changes to your forked remote\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git push` to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push  remote master`\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You will be asked for your Github user name and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Verify the changes in your forked repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to Github, reload the website and check whether the version in your repo match the version on the main course repo.\n"
