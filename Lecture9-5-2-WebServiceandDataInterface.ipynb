    "\n",
    "Data is central to data science. The ability to find and gather useful data is extremely useful. As we have seen with NBA data, things can be challenging to reverse engineer websites. We will look at other sources of data and various software terminologies around web services that provide data interfaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Frontend and Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many layers to a web service we interact with everyday. Take our jupyter notebook for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We open the URL for the course Jupyter notebook,\n",
    "* When we enter commands into a notebook,\n",
    "* An instance of python \"kernel\" runs the line(s) of code,\n",
    "* Takes the output and sends it back to the user, and\n",
    "* The running notebook displays the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somethings happen in our browser, and somethings happen on the servers. What we see and what we interact with is called the __frontend__, and our requests are taken care of by the __backend__. The frontend and backend communicate using a __protocol__. So, \n",

    "* Python kernel is the backend\n",
    "* The frontend and the backend communicate via http (hypertext transfer protocol).\n",

    "In the url window, enter `javascript:alert('hello')`.Any browser would work except the chrome incognito. There is a javascript engine that interprets your javascript code. Javascript language is the basis for many frontend libraries. IPython widgets (for selecting basketball players) are such examples.\n",

    "### Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "Backend is the business-end of web services. The backend usually is made up of a server (a real or virtual computer), an application (that interprets your requests), and a database (where information is stored). We usually do not see what goes on in the backend, and we are allowed access through service providers' means to communicate.\n",
